Cloud computing has become essential for modern application deployment. As a Senior Full Stack Developer, I've been using AWS to deploy and scale applications.

## Why Cloud Computing?

- **Scalability**: Scale up or down as needed
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Pay only for what you use
- **Reliability**: High availability and durability
- **Global Reach**: Deploy worldwide

### Popular AWS Services

- **EC2**: Virtual servers
- **S3**: Object storage
- **Lambda**: Serverless computing
- **RDS**: Managed databases
- **CloudFront**: Content delivery

### Example: Deploying to AWS

```
bash
# Install AWS CLI
pip install awscli

# Configure AWS
aws configure

# Deploy to S3
aws s3 sync ./build s3://my-bucket-name
```

> "The cloud is not just someone else's computer."

## Getting Started
