Python is the dominant language for AI and Machine Learning development. As an AI Specialist, I've been using Python extensively for building ML models and AI applications.

## Why Python for AI?

- **Rich Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn
- **Easy to Learn**: Simple syntax
- **Community Support**: Huge ecosystem
- **Integration**: Works well with other tools

### Popular Libraries

```
python
# Example: Simple Linear Regression
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
print(model.predict([[6]]))
```
