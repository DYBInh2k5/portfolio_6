Next.js has become one of the most popular frameworks for building modern web applications. As a Full Stack Developer, I've been using Next.js extensively for both client and server-side rendering.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Better SEO and performance
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Blazing fast load times
- **API Routes**: Build full-stack applications
- **Image Optimization**: Built-in image optimization

### Key Features

```
javascript
// Example Next.js page
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

> "Next.js is the React framework for the web."

## Getting Started

To start with Next.js:

1. Install Node.js
2. Create a new project: `npx create-next-app@latest`
