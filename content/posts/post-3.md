React Native allows you to build cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React. As a Mobile App Developer, I've created several apps using this technology.

## Why React Native?

- **Write Once, Deploy Everywhere**: One codebase for iOS and Android
- **Native Performance**: Uses actual native components
- **Large Community**: Extensive libraries and resources
- **Hot Reload**: See changes instantly

### Key Concepts

```
javascript
// Example React Native Component
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello, React Native!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Getting Started

1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Install Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
3. Create a new project: `npx create-expo-app my-app`
4. Start building!
