TypeScript has become essential for modern web development. As a Full Stack Developer, I've been using TypeScript to build type-safe applications.

## Why TypeScript?

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
- **Better IDE Support**: Autocomplete and refactoring
- **Improved Code Quality**: More maintainable code
- **Modern Features**: Latest JavaScript features

### Basic Types

```
typescript
// TypeScript Basic Types
let name: string = "Võ Duy Bình";
let age: number = 25;
let isDeveloper: boolean = true;

// Arrays
let skills: string[] = ["React", "Next.js", "Python"];

// Objects
interface Developer {
  name: string;
  skills: string[];
  experience: number;
}
```

## Getting Started

1. Install TypeScript: `npm install -g typescript`
2. Initialize: `tsc --init`
3. Configure tsconfig.json
4. Start coding!
