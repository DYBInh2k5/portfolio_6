Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way we build applications. As a Full Stack Developer & AI Specialist, I've been working extensively with modern AI tools and frameworks to create innovative solutions.

## Why AI Development Matters

In 2025, AI has become an essential part of software development. From code generation to automated testing, AI tools are helping developers build better applications faster.

### Key AI Technologies to Learn

- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Large Language Models**: OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, YOLO, MediaPipe

> "AI is not just a tool - it's a new way of thinking about problem-solving."

## Getting Started

To start your AI development journey, I recommend:

1. Learn Python fundamentals
2. Understand basic statistics and linear algebra
3. Explore machine learning libraries
4. Build small projects progressively
