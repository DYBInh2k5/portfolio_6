Following best practices is essential for building maintainable and scalable web applications. As a Senior Full Stack Developer, I've learned the importance of writing clean, efficient code.

## Key Best Practices

### 1. Code Organization
- Use modular architecture
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Keep components small and focused

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Minimize bundle size
- Use lazy loading
- Optimize images

### 3. Accessibility
- Semantic HTML
- ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation

> "Clean code is happy code."

## Tools and Linters

```
javascript
// ESLint configuration
{
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-vars": "error",
    "prefer-const": "error"
  }
}
```

*Best Practices*

Always write code as if the next person to read it is a violent psychopath who knows where you live.
